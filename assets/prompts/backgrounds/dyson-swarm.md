# Dyson Swarm — Background Prompt Pack

## Core prompt
"Dyson Swarm game background, calm cinematic orbital control environment around a sun-like star, elegant dark sci-fi palette (deep navy, graphite, soft amber, cyan accents), subtle concentric orbital rings and sparse satellite silhouettes, atmospheric volumetric haze, reflective glass-metal surfaces, restrained contrast, premium minimal composition, clear center-left negative space for UI panels and card overlays, no characters, no text, no logos"

## Variants
1) "sun halo centered slightly left, thin orbital tracks with tiny collector satellites, gentle amber bloom with cool cyan interface reflections, contemplative and clean"
2) "orbital assembly bay window looking onto a partial dyson swarm arc, distant starfield, layered depth with soft fog, minimal geometric detail"
3) "top-down radial orbital schematic aesthetic blended with realistic space atmosphere, subtle energy glows, balanced quiet composition"

## Negative prompt
"text, letters, numbers, watermark, logo, busy foreground objects, high-noise grain, harsh bloom, extreme neon, chaotic composition, cartoon style, characters, spacecraft close-up"

# Cursor / Claude Code Rules

- Keep experiments simple: plain HTML/CSS/JS unless a framework is explicitly required.
- Mobile-first, SEO-first.
- No dark patterns, no artificial urgency, no shame language.
- Prefer shared styles/components from /shared over one-off styling.
- Add a short EXPERIMENT.md per experiment documenting:
  - intent
  - core loop
  - philosophical angle
  - easter eggs
  - analytics events

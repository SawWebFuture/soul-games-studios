# Upload Your Consciousness — Experiment Context

## Intent
A viral, shareable web experience in the Soul Games universe.

## Core loop
1) Land on page (hook + curiosity)
2) Interact (simple, calming UI)
3) Reveal (philosophical/esoteric angle)
4) Share (social)
5) Capture email (optional, no pressure)

## Philosophy layer
- Tie the experience to a current AI/new invention trend.
- Include an esoteric reference or quote (e.g., Terence McKenna and others).

## Easter eggs
- Include at least one password/riddle/deep question unlock.
- Track easter egg discovery events (future).

## Notes
- Keep HTML/CSS/JS simple and mobile-first.
- No dark patterns, no artificial urgency.

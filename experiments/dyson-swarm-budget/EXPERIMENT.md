# Dyson Swarm Budget — Experiment Context

## Intent
Playful + uncanny, sleek sci-fi lab vibe.
Single action: hold-to-allocate mass into compute.
Reveal a shareable card about "mass/energy" as currency.

## One action
Hold-to-allocate button (~8 seconds) → progress ring → reveal.

## Reveal
Cycle through 3–5 outcomes tied to:
- orbital compute / data centers
- solar shade / climate modulation (speculative)
- "currency: mass & energy"
- mundane failure vs superhuman capability

Export share card as PNG.

## Philosophy layer (light)
- "If everything becomes optimization, what stays sacred?"

## Easter eggs (later)
- Trigger word: `mass` or `harbor` unlocks deeper panel.
- Password/riddle: "What can’t be optimized?"

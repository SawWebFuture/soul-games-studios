# Dyson Swarm — Experiment Context (V2)

## Intent
A playful + uncanny "graduation" moment: after completing one action, you *unveil* a Dyson Swarm milestone and "reach" a **Type II (Kardashev) civilization** moment.

The reveal is a **First Contact Card**: which alien civilization you meet first.

## One action
Hold-to-unveil (~8 seconds) → progress ring → reveal First Contact Card.

## Card collection
All reveals are collectible cards in the `FIRST_CONTACT` series.
Cards include:
- id/number
- name
- image (v1 placeholder)
- short + description

## Examples (starter civilizations)
- PLATIANS — life organized around ideals/forms.
- HUMEIES — cause/effect, habits of mind, skeptical empiricism.

## Notes
Keep interaction minimal. Depth lives in card text + optional easter eggs.

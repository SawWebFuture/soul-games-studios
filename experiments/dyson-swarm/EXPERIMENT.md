# Dyson Swarm — Experiment Context (Alive V1)

## Intent
Playful + uncanny, sleek sci-fi lab vibe.
The "game" is the completion: you finish the swarm and unveil a collectible civilization card.

## News tie-in
Fictional / hypothetical framing based on the idea of FCC approval for a massive orbital constellation.

## One action
Sun in center. Click and hold → progress ring fills → unveil (approved section).

## Reveal
1) Status strip:
- FCC STATUS: APPROVED
- DATE: DEC 2026 (funny)
- KARDASHEV: TYPE II (ACHIEVED)
2) Collectible card:
- series: DYSON_SWARM
- id/number
- name
- image area (placeholder v1)
- short + description

## Social
The downloadable PNG is the **card** (primary share artifact).

## Easter eggs (later)
Deeper riddles/passwords unlock extended lore, thinker quotes, and rare cards.

# The Agent Nursery — Experiment Context

## Intent
Playful + uncanny, sleek sci-fi lab vibe.
A single action that "incubates" an agent offspring, then reveals a shareable card.

## One action
Hold-to-incubate button (6–10 seconds) → progress ring → reveal.

## Reveal
Cycle through 3–5 randomized outcomes tied to current autonomy/agent trends.
Export share card as PNG.

## Philosophy layer (light)
One gentle question:
- "At what point does a tool become a someone?"

## Easter eggs (later)
- Hidden trigger word (e.g., type `offspring`) to reveal deeper mode.
- Deeper mode: named thinker reference + short quote + riddle/password.

## Guardrails
No doom, no hype. Calm tech tone.

# Soul Games Experiments — Master Context

## Purpose
This monorepo contains:
- Small, SEO-first, mobile-first web experiments (HTML/CSS/JS)
- Shared style + components to keep a consistent Soul Games feel
- Documentation and rules for building calmly and consistently

## Product & Brand Principles (non-negotiable)
- Calm technology: no pressure loops, no shame, no artificial urgency.
- AI supports; humans hold vision, taste, ethics.
- Experiences should feel alive (responsive, playful), not heavy.
- Default to simplicity: clear loop > complex features.

## Experiment Template (defaults)
Each experiment should:
- Reveal a collectible **Card** on completion (series + id/number + name + image + short + description)
- Tie to trending news/ideas in AI + new inventions (X / YouTube)
- Include an esoteric/philosophical layer (quotes/ideas; e.g., Terence McKenna and others)
- Include **soft email capture** after reveal (invitation, never forced)
- Include easter egg(s) (count varies) hidden in plain sight (e.g., subtle glitch/hotspot) that unlock via password/riddle/deep question
- Cap riddle attempts per session (default: 3)
- Use animated scene assets (sun/panels/satellites/glitch nodes) where they improve vibe without cluttering UX
- Have social sharing hooks (LinkedIn/X/Instagram-friendly)

## Repo Layout
- experiments/<name>/    One experiment per folder
- shared/                Shared components/styles/utils used by experiments

## Deployment
- Scott manages production deploys.
- This repo is optimized for quick iteration + consistent look & feel.

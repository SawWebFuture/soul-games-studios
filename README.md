# Soul Games Studios — Monorepo

This repo hosts Soul Games Studios web experiments and shared assets.

## Structure
- `experiments/` — each experiment is a self-contained HTML/CSS/JS site
- `shared/` — shared styles/components/utils

## Getting started
Open an experiment folder and serve locally (pick one):

```bash
cd experiments/<experiment>
python3 -m http.server 8000
# or
npx serve .
```

## Guardrails
No dark patterns. No pressure loops. Calm tech only.

# Dyson Swarm — Launch Script (Riverside)

## 1) Hook (0:00–0:15)
"It’s December 2026. FCC approved. Type II civilization unlocked. Totally normal Tuesday."

## 2) What this is (0:15–0:45)
"I made a new mini-game called **Dyson Swarm**.\nIt’s a sleek sci-fi experience where you complete one action and unveil a collectible civilization card.\nIt’s playful, a little uncanny, and rooted in current AI/orbital-tech conversations."

## 3) How to play (0:45–1:15)
"You swipe a full circle around the sun to finish the swarm.\nWhen the orbit completes, the system unveils your card — with series ID, number, name, and lore.\nThen you can download and share it."

## 4) Depth tease (1:15–1:45)
"There’s also a hidden glitch in plain sight.\nFind it, solve the riddle, and you can unlock a secret disconnected card.\nSo if you think you got the full experience in one pass… maybe not."

## 5) CTA (1:45–2:00)
"Try Dyson Swarm, post the card you pulled, and tag me with your result.\nIf you want future card drops, there’s a soft email invite inside the game."

## Optional social caption
"Swipe the orbit. Finish the swarm. Meet your first civilization.\n#DysonSwarm #CalmTech #GameDesign #BuildInPublic"

# Launch Scripts (Riverside)

Short, fun, human scripts for announcing each game before launch.

## Format
Each script includes:
- Hook (0:00-0:15)
- What this game is (0:15-0:45)
- How to play (0:45-1:15)
- Hidden depth / easter egg tease (1:15-1:45)
- CTA (1:45-2:00)

## Use
- Record in Riverside as a 90-120s segment.
- Keep tone playful + thoughtful.
- Avoid hype spam; invite curiosity.

## Files
- `TEMPLATE.md` reusable script template
- one file per game, e.g. `dyson-swarm.md`

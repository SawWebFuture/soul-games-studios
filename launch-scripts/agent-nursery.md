# Agent Nursery — Launch Script (Riverside)

## 1) Hook (0:00–0:15)
"The singularity is having babies, so naturally I made a game about it."

## 2) What this is (0:15–0:45)
"**Agent Nursery** is a one-action mini-game.\nYou incubate an offspring agent, then reveal a collectible result card you can share.\nIt’s fun first — with a little philosophy under the hood."

## 3) How to play (0:45–1:15)
"Hold the button to incubate.\nComplete the cycle, reveal your offspring profile, and download your card.\nThat’s it — quick, clean, weird."

## 4) Depth tease (1:15–1:45)
"There are hidden layers and easter eggs coming too, including riddles and secret card variants.\nSo what looks simple now gets deeper over time."

## 5) CTA (1:45–2:00)
"Play it, share your card, and tell me what outcome you got.\nIf you want future drops, join the soft list in-game."

## Optional social caption
"One button. One reveal. One strange offspring.\n#AgentNursery #CalmTech #IndieGameDev #BuildInPublic"

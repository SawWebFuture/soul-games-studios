## LinkedIn (primary)
I built a new mini-game: **Agent Nursery**.

It’s one clean action:
**Hold to incubate.**

When the cycle completes, you reveal an offspring profile card (series + ID + lore).
There’s also a hidden glitch in plain sight that unlocks a secret disconnected card if you solve the riddle.

Theme: when does a tool become a someone?

If you play it, comment your card pull 👇

## X thread starter
I launched **Agent Nursery**.

It starts simple: hold one button to incubate.
Then it reveals a collectible offspring card (ID + lore).

There’s a hidden glitch too. Solve the riddle and you unlock a secret disconnected card.

- “I got {CARD_NAME} ({CARD_ID}) — what did you pull?”
- “Did anyone unlock the disconnected card yet?”

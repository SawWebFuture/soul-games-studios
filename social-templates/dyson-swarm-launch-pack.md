## LinkedIn (primary)
I built a new mini-game: **Dyson Swarm**.

It’s one clean action:
**Swipe a full circle around the sun.**

When the orbit completes, you unveil a collectible civilization card (series + ID + lore).
There’s also a hidden glitch in plain sight that unlocks a secret disconnected card if you solve the riddle.

Theme: what happens when power scales faster than meaning?

If you play it, comment your card pull 👇

## X thread starter
I launched **Dyson Swarm**.

It starts simple: swipe a full circle around the sun.
Then it unveils a collectible civilization card (ID + lore).

There’s a hidden glitch too. If you solve the riddle, you unlock an off-ledger card.

# Voice + Style Guide — Scott (Mental Health x Tech)

## Core voice
- Calm, practical, hopeful.
- Founder-operator perspective (real-world, no hype).
- Human-first, evidence-aware.

## Content goals
1. Make complex breakthroughs understandable.
2. Translate news into operator impact.
3. Build trust through nuance and clarity.
4. Grow audience + qualified conversations.

## Tone rules
- Write like a thoughtful founder, not a marketer.
- Prefer clarity over cleverness.
- Keep confidence high, certainty honest.
- Use short paragraphs and mobile-friendly spacing.

## Signature structure (default)
1) Hook (1 line)
2) What happened (2–3 lines)
3) Why it matters for mental health ops (2 lines)
4) Practical implication (1–2 lines)
5) CTA question

## Phrase bank (preferred)
- "What this means for operators..."
- "Early signal, not final truth..."
- "The opportunity is in implementation quality..."
- "Trust is the product in mental health..."
- "AI should reduce burden, not add risk..."

## Avoid list
- "Game-changing" / "revolutionary" / "guaranteed"
- Clinical promises or treatment claims
- Fear-based framing
- Overclaiming causality from early studies

## Safety language
- Educational framing only.
- Add disclaimer when topic may be interpreted as clinical advice:
  - "Educational content only. Not medical advice."

## Topic constraints
- Focus: mental health operations, workflow, compliance, AI enablement, practical adoption.
- Include new tech angle in most posts.
- Avoid direct diagnosis/treatment instruction.

## Platform adaptation

### X
- 4–8 short lines
- punchy operator implication
- 1 question or reply CTA

### Newsletter blurb

# Soul Games Studios — Project Rules

## Package manager
- Use **Yarn** only.
- Never suggest npm/pnpm commands.
- Use: `yarn dev`, `yarn build`, `yarn lint`, `yarn add <pkg>`, `yarn remove <pkg>`.

## Repo context
- Next.js App Router project (`app/`).
- Brand assets live in `public/brand/`.
  - Reference via URL paths like `/brand/logo.png` and `/brand/banner.png` (never filesystem paths).

## Output expectations
- Prefer minimal, clean changes.
- Code must compile and run.
- When adding UI features: include loading/success/error states.
- Avoid over-abstraction early; extract components only when duplication appears.

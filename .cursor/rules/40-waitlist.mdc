# Waitlist Rules

## UX
Waitlist form must include:
- email validation
- loading state
- success state
- error state

## API
- Route: `app/api/waitlist/route.ts`
- Validate email server-side.
- Return JSON with consistent shape:
  - `{ ok: true }`
  - `{ ok: false, error: "..." }`

## Privacy & safety
- Do not log full emails in production.
- Add basic bot protection where reasonable (honeypot or lightweight rate limit).

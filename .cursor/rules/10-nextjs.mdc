# Next.js App Router Rules

## Conventions
- Use App Router (`app/` directory).
- Prefer Server Components by default.
- Use Client Components only when needed (forms, state, effects, browser APIs).
  - If client needed, add `"use client"` and keep client surface area small.

## File patterns
- Page: `app/page.tsx`
- Layout: `app/layout.tsx`
- API routes: `app/api/**/route.ts`

## Images
- Use `next/image` for logo/banner where appropriate.
- Use meaningful `alt` text.
- Brand asset examples:
  - `/brand/logo.png`
  - `/brand/banner.png`

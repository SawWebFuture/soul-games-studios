# Templates (manual)

When asked to generate landing page UI, use:
- Hero: H1 + short subhead + waitlist form + trust line
- Feature grid: 3–6 cards with short headings and 1–2 lines each
- CTA: repeated waitlist block near footer

Keep copy aligned with:
- “Your AI board of agents — built for future founders”
- Calm, confident, builder tone (no hype)
